# Project-2

## Descrpition

In this project my group constructed a website intended for user interested in National Parks. We displayed all 61 National Parks in either Popularity Ranking, Alphabetically and by State. In addition to the sorted parks, there are links to the actual website for each park and an additional link to recreational maps.
